Network Configuration Management (NCM) is the procedure of arranging and keeping up data about every one of the parts of a Computer Network. It is not just a day by day and crucial necessity in Computer Network frameworks however it likewise structures a portion of a boundless field of innovative work. Numerous operational issues confronting system directors today come about because of an absence of configuration management capabilities. While trying to comprehend existing frameworks set up and flow innovative work identifying with Network Configuration Management, studies identifying with comparative applications have been did and ideas have been dismembered to assess their conceivable commitments into the improvement of a Network Configuration Management System. With the fast advancement of Artificial Neural Network (ANN), wise substances are additionally created to bolster the basic appropriation of Network Configuration Management System. In the flow of this paper, we will go through evolution of network configuration management system to understand the key factors and peer review of some referenced prototype. We will discuss some of the integrated and intelligent network management modules introduced till date, i.e., Web Based, CMDB, and CAMM. The paper can be further extended to address network monitoring tool and Network fault management system for advanced discussion on Network management System.
